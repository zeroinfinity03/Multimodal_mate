# Multimodal Mate

## Overview

**Multimodal Mate** is a web application designed to handle and understand various user inputs, including text, images, and documents. It leverages the **Gemini 1.5 Flash** language model for processing text and image inputs and employs a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, powered by **LlamaIndex**, to manage document-based queries. This design offers an intuitive interface with comprehensive backend processing capabilities.

## Features

### Direct Processing with Gemini 1.5 Flash

- **Text Inputs**: Directly sent to Gemini 1.5 Flash for immediate responses based solely on text content.
- **Image and Text Inputs**: Gemini's multimodal capability allows it to process queries combining text and images, producing responses that consider both modalities.
- **Audio/Video Support**: While the backend supports audio and video files, the current focus is primarily on image processing.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline for Document-Based Queries

- **Supported Document Types**: PDFs, PowerPoint presentations (PPTs), Excel files (XLSX), CSV files, and JSON files are processed through the RAG pipeline.
  
- **Processing Workflow**:
  - **Document Ingestion**: Uses `SimpleDirectoryReader` to read and ingest document files, eliminating the need for individual document processors.
  - **Embedding Generation and Indexing**: Extracted content from documents is converted into embeddings using the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model via `HuggingFaceEmbedding` and stored in a `VectorStoreIndex` for efficient retrieval.
  - **Contextual Retrieval**: Relevant information is retrieved from the index when a user query relates to document content.
  - **Augmented Generation**: Retrieved document information augments the user's query, enabling Gemini 1.5 Flash to generate a response that incorporates both query and document context.

## User Interface and Input Handling

### Frontend

- **HTML and Tailwind CSS**: Provides the user interface with a responsive design.
- **JavaScript (`app.js`)**: Manages frontend logic, including user interactions, file uploads, and asynchronous API calls. Supports text input, file uploads, and displays chat history with syntax highlighting for code blocks.

### Backend (FastAPI)

- **Routes Defined in `main.py`**:
  - `GET /`: Serves the main HTML page.
  - `POST /upload`: Processes file uploads and indexing.
  - `POST /chat`: Handles chat messages, including text, image, and document-based queries.

## Document Processing and RAG Pipeline

### Document Ingestion

Handled by `SimpleDirectoryReader`, which processes various file types without separate processors.

### Data Standardization and Chunking

- **Standardization**: Text is standardized using LlamaIndex's Document objects for consistency.
- **Chunking**:
  - **Default Chunking Behavior**: The `VectorStoreIndex` uses default chunking strategies provided by LlamaIndex. It employs a default text splitter that chunks text into segments, typically based on character or token count. There's some overlap between chunks to maintain context.
  - **Text Splitting and Chunking**: This process ensures that large documents are broken down into manageable pieces, allowing for efficient indexing and retrieval without losing the semantic meaning across chunks.

### Embedding Generation and Indexing

- Uses `HuggingFaceEmbedding` with the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.
- Embeddings are stored in a `VectorStoreIndex` for efficient similarity-based retrieval.

## Query Processing and Response Generation

### Direct Queries (Text and Image)

- Sent directly to Gemini 1.5 Flash when no documents are indexed.

### Document-Related Queries (RAG Pipeline)

- When documents are present, the RAG pipeline is used for all subsequent queries.
- Retrieves relevant document chunks using similarity search within the vector index.
- The retrieved information augments the user's query before processing with Gemini 1.5 Flash.

## Current Limitation

A key limitation is that once documents are indexed, the system remains in RAG mode for all queries, potentially including irrelevant document context in responses to general questions.

## Proposed Solution

Implementing a relevance check in the chat endpoint could allow dynamic switching between RAG and direct processing modes based on the query's relevance to indexed content.

## Integration and Workflow

### Workflow Summary

1. **User Interaction**: The user submits a query, which could be:
   - A text message.
   - An image plus text query.
   - A query related to document content.

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - **Direct Queries**: For text and image inputs (when no documents are indexed), the query is sent directly to Gemini 1.5 Flash.
   - **Document-Based Queries**: When documents are present, the RAG pipeline processes the query, retrieving relevant document data to augment the query.
   - **Response Generation**: The (augmented) query is sent to Gemini 1.5 Flash for final response generation.

3. **Frontend Update**: The response is displayed in the chat interface, providing real-time feedback and maintaining conversation history.

## Technologies and Components Used

### Frontend

- **HTML and Tailwind CSS**: For the user interface and responsive design.

### Document Processing and Retrieval

- **SimpleDirectoryReader**: For streamlined document ingestion without separate processors.
- **VectorStoreIndex**: For efficient embedding storage and retrieval of document content.
- Utilizes default chunking strategies provided by LlamaIndex, including text splitting and chunking based on character or token count with overlap to maintain context.

### Language Model

- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: For multimodal language processing.
